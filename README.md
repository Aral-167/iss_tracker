# ISS Real-Time Tracker & Space Dashboard

This is a feature-rich, interactive web application that provides real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS) and a dashboard of other fascinating astronomical data. The project is built with a Python Flask backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.
Fun fact: This project normally started as a ISS tracker (the name!) but after I decided to add more features to it so now it's an ISS tracker and a site to explore the cosmos.

## Features

- **Real-Time ISS Tracking**: See the current location of the ISS on an interactive world map, updated every 5 seconds.
- **Live ISS Video Feed**: Watch a live video stream from the ISS (subject to availability).
- **NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**: Discover the cosmos with a new image or video each day, complete with detailed explanations.
- **Current Moon Phase**: View the current phase of the moon, its illumination percentage, and age.
- **Star of the Day**: Learn about a different star each day, including its constellation, distance, magnitude, and other interesting facts.
- **NASA Mars Weather Report**: Get the latest weather update from Mars, including temperature and pressure.
- **Your Weight on Other Planets**: A fun calculator to see how much you would weigh on different planets and celestial bodies in our solar system.
- **Timeline of the Universe**: A vertical timeline showcasing major events from the Big Bang to the present day.
- **Moonrise & Moonset Times**: Get moonrise and moonset times for your current location or any specified location.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
